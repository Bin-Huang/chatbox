## Why use ChatBox?

- Directly using or testing the OpenAI API can be quite challenging, requiring an understanding of programming, and may lack convenience. ChatBox can help you handle all of the underlying things.
- ChatBox also saves all chat messages and prompts locally, preventing data loss in online services.
- ChatBox can help you design, debug, and manage prompts, giving you greater control over the AI interface.

## Alternative to ChatGPT Plus?

Feasible. Compared to ChatGPT Plus, the OpenAI Developer API can achieve exactly the same results, and has the following advantages:

- Unlike ChatGPT Plus's fixed monthly charge of $20, OpenAI Developer API is pay-as-you-go, and hence has lower overall usage cost.
- The OpenAI Developer API can more directly use the GPT model behind ChatGPT, such as flexible prompt role debugging and parameter debugging.
- ChatBox is a cross-platform desktop client, which is more convenient to use than the web interface.

## Chatbox Team Sharing Feature

Using AI to enhance your team productivity, is an important feature of Chatbox.

Chatbox allows your team members to share the resources of the same OpenAI API account without exposing your API KEY. View [tutorial](./team-sharing/README.md).

## Why I made Chatbox?

I developed Chatbox initially because I was debugging some prompts and found myself in need of a simple and easy-to-use prompt and API debugging tool. I thought there might be more people who needed such a tool, so I open-sourced it.

At first, I didn't know that it would be so popular. I listened to the feedback from the open-source community and continued to develop and improve it. Now, it has become a very useful AI desktop application. There are many users who love Chatbox, and they not only use it for developing and debugging prompts, but also for daily chatting, and even to do some more interesting things like using well-designed prompts to make AI play various professional roles to assist them in everyday work...

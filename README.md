## Why Use Chatbox?

- Directly testing OpenAI API might be challenging for those with no programming background. By using Chatbox, you can perform such experiments in a convenient way.
- Chatbox stores all chat messages and prompts locally, thus reducing the risk of data loss.
- Chatbox helps you design, debug, and manage prompts, thus providing greater control over the AI interface.

## Alternative to ChatGPT Plus?

The idea is feasible. OpenAI also provides a developer API service, which offers the same functionality as ChatGPT Plus and some additional benefits as follows: 

1. Unlike ChatGPT Plus, which charges a fixed monthly fee of $20, the developer API service charges based on usage, resulting in lower overall costs.
2. The developer API service enables more direct use of the model behind ChatGPT, such as using more flexible prompt role debugging and parameter debugging.
